# API & Webscraping: Premier League

This project involved obtaining and enriching data by performing web scraping. Data collected was organized, cleaned, and analyzed to gain insights into the Premier League season 2022/2023.

Specifically, we investigated the following questions:

1. Were teams more likely to play aggressively at home or away? 
      Analysis was conducted to determine if a correlation existed between the venue (home or away) and the level of team aggressiveness.

2. Based on the strictness of referees, were they more inclined to give fouls? 
      The behaviour of referees was examined to identify patterns related to their strictness when making foul calls.

This project provided valuable insights into team behaviour and referee tendencies during the season ,so far, and contributed to a better understanding of match dynamics, team strategies and referee management.
